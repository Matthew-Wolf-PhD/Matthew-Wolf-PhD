I am a Data Scientist and Researcher passionate about analyzing interesting datasets, as well as visualizing data and writing about data. I enjoy asking interesting questions of data and then in communicating my data analysis results to different audiences through presentations, written reports, and in articles. I am interested in using data analysis and data visualization to tell broader stories and to make predictions.
